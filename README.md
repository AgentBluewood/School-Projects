Website Project: Folder containing a website I created for class. The website allows users to create accounts, sign in, purchase fuel, and logout. The website was written using mostly PHP and CSS/HTML along with SQL for the database.  
 
Operating Systems Homeworks: Three homework assignments I completed for my operating systems class. The assignments demonstrate the uses of multithreading, interprocess communication betwen a server and client, and the use of semaphores.
